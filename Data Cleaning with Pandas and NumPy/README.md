![cartoon-machine-learning-class](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40051540/86053707-81577880-ba1e-11ea-898f-2cbcd3cdfd05.jpg)

<p>Cleaning datasets is an integral part of being a Data Scientist. In fact, a lot of Data Scientists agree that obtaining and cleaning data is 80% of the job as a Data Scientist. It is important to know how to clean a dataset that has a number of Nan rows and columns and inconsistent formatting. Data in the real world is not always well-structured and model-training ready. It is also a very time consuming process, so learning the skills to cleverly use Pandas and NumPy can help you considerbly save time and get going with more intersting stuff!</p>

<p> In this notebook, we will do exactly that! We will look at how to clean a table accquired from <b>data.census.gov</b>. We are going to be working with the <b>POVERTY STATUS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS Table Data<b></p>

<p>We will cover the following:</p>
<h3>1. Importing csv file into pandas as DataFrames
<h3>2. Dropping columns in a DataFrame
<h3>2. Tiding up fields in the data whilst retaining information
<h3>3. Filtering and selecting rows in Pandas
<h3>4. Cleaning the entire dataset using the apply function
<h3>5. Renaming columns to have more consistent names
<h3>6. Reset and drop index of a DataFrame
<h3>7. Converting columns to appropriate datatypes
<h3>8. Visualozing the clean data set using Plotly
