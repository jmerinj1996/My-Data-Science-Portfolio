> Cleaning datasets is an integral part of being a Data Scientist. In fact, a lot of Data Scientists agree that obtaining and cleaning data is 80% of the job as a Data Scientist. It is important to know how to clean a dataset that has a number of Nan rows and columns and inconsistent formatting. Data in the real world is not always well-structured and model-training ready. It is also a very time consuming process, so learning the skills to cleverly use Pandas and NumPy can help you considerbly save time and get going with more intersting stuff!

> In this notebook, we will do exactly that! We will look at how to clean a table accquired from **data.census.gov**. We are going to be working with the **POVERTY STATUS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS Table Data**

>We will cover the following:
1. Importing csv file into pandas as DataFrames
2. Dropping columns in a DataFrame
2. Tiding up fields in the data whilst retaining information
3. Filtering and selecting rows in Pandas
4. Cleaning the entire dataset using the **apply** function
5. Renaming columns to have more consistent names
6. Reset and drop index of a DataFrame
7. Converting columns to appropriate datatypes
8. Visualozing the clean data set using Plotly
