DonorsChoose.org is an excellent platform if you are thinking of connecting and donating to public schools. Their mission is to help make donating to classrooms easier for anyone who wants to. Donating to classrooms couldn't get any easier: you find the project that inspires you, make your donation, once the project is fully funded donorschoose purchases all the requested items and ship them directly to the school. And an added bonus, every donor gets a thank-you letter from the teacher, photos from the classroom, and a report of how each dollar was spent. Isn't that amazing!

The hard part though, is choosing the right project that inspires you. There are about 1,109,972 unique projects you can donate to on DonorsChoose.org. How will you find out what projects interests you? Hopefully, this notebook will answer exactly that. Read on
