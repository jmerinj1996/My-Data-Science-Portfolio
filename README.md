<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
📊 Hi, I'm Jeffy, a graduate Data Scientist passionate about developing predictive models specifically, that help tackle societal problems. I am a data-driven storyteller characterized with a passion for coding and a zeal to take on challenges.

🏆 Skilled in data cleansing, wrangling, visualization and machine learning. Worked extensively with machine learning and data mining techniques to infer insights and make predictions in Python.

🏆 My superpower would be building recommender systems - Content Based, Collaborative Filtering, SVD, Deep Learning and Hybrid.

🔎 On a personal level, I am detailed oriented, organized and precise in my work. The only thing cleaner than my apartment are my Jupyter notebooks and spreadsheets :)
