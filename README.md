<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
📊 Hi, I'm Jeffy, a graduate Data Scientist passionate about developing predictive models specifically, that help tackle societal problems. I am a data-driven storyteller characterized with a passion for coding and a zeal to take on challenges.

🏆 Skilled in data cleansing, wrangling, visualization and machine learning. Worked extensively with machine learning and data mining techniques to infer insights and make predictions in Python.

🏆 My superpower would be building recommender systems - Content Based, Collaborative Filtering, SVD, Deep Learning and Hybrid.

🔎 On a personal level, I am detailed oriented, organized and precise in my work. The only thing cleaner than my apartment are my Jupyter notebooks and spreadsheets :)

<h3>Who I do?</h3>

I am a proud Trojan, class of 2019 with a Master’s degree in Computer Science - specialization in Data Science. As much as I understand that data science requires sound knowledge of statistics and programming, which USC has done an excellent job equipping me with, I also believe creativity and risk taking are key characteristics of a good data scientist.

I love exploring interesting data on the internet and spend most of my time prepping data because I am convinced that in order to do the “science”, you first need good data. Through my years at University, I have acquired skills in data cleansing, wrangling, visualization and machine learning.

I am a data- driven storyteller and I involve my heart and hands in everything I do. Internships have challenged me to work hard, push boundaries and think outside the box, but most of all, it has taught me the importance of building relationships and helping others achieve the same American dream!
