## Objective âš’ 
In this notebook, we will interpret ASL images using TensorFlow. Things we will cover:
<h4>1. Create the train and test data
<h4>2. Determine training and network parameters
<h4>3. Construct the neural network
<h4>4. Define our loss function and SGD Optimizer
<h4>5. Train the neural network
<h4>6. Validate the model
<h4>7. Results</h4>

<li><b>TensorFlow</b> is -  It is a Python library that allows you to create neural networks with many layers. It is free and open source and was developed by Google.
<li>Although there are neural networks that are specifically well suited for image recognition, we actually don't need to go there for this relatively simple task.
<li>There are libraries like Keras and TFLearn that run on top of TensorFlow.These are higher level API's to TensorFlow, but for this dataset, we can do without any of these libraries.
